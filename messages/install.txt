KeybardSpellCheck
=================

A Sublime Text 3 plugin that allows you to spell check the word under the cursor from the keyboard (vi style). Press ```control+alt+k``` or ```z=``` 
in command mode to display spelling suggestions. 

If the ```use_google``` setting is set to true, Google's best guess for what you meant will also be displayed as the [0]G option.


Installation
------------

  This package requires the enchant spell checking package. On Mac this can be installed using ```brew install enchant```. 
  For windows there is an executable installer. I have no information on Linux installation at this time.
