A Sublime Text 2/3 plugin that allows you to spell check the word under the cursor from the keyboard (vi style). Press ```control+alt+k``` or ```z=``` in command mode to display spelling suggestions. Use ```[s``` and ```]s``` to step through spelling errors in command mode.

If the ```use_google``` setting is set to true, Google's best guess for what you meant will also be displayed as the first option.


                    **** Important [Installation] *****

This package requires the enchant spell checking package. On Mac this can be installed using ```brew install enchant```. 

For windows there is an executable installer. 

Most distributions of Linux come with enchant installed by default.
