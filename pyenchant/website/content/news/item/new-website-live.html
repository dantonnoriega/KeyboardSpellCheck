<p>The PyEnchant project has a new website!</p>

<p>Yes, I've finally gotten around to moving things off my <a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/">personal website</a> and onto the free documentation hosting provided by the <a href="http://packages.python.org/">cheeseshop</a>.  The site is built using a combination of <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">sphinx</a> for the API docs and tutorial, and <a href="http://hyde.github.com/">hyde</a> for the general layout and management.</p>
